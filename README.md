# Quick Access Button for G Pay settings

This is just a copy of [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alextopala.shortcutforgpaysettings) because it was not available for my country/phone.

So I've made my own version.

## Description

For countries where the G Pay app is not available but cards can be added to use G Pay (from Revolut, Curve etc...).
After installation a quick tile action becomes available to choose and put into the quick actions.
The quick action tile will show as active/inactive according to your phone NFC status.
